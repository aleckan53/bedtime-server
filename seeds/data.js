      <p>Once upon a time there was an old woman who loved baking gingerbread. She would bake gingerbread cookies, cakes, houses and gingerbread people, all decorated with chocolate and peppermint, caramel candies and colored frosting.</p>
      <p>She lived with her husband on a farm at the edge of town. The sweet spicy smell of gingerbread brought children skipping and running to see what would be offered that day.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately the children gobbled up the treats so fast that the old woman had a hard time keeping her supply of flour and spices to continue making the batches of gingerbread. Sometimes she suspected little hands of having reached through her kitchen window because gingerbread pieces and cookies would disappear. One time a whole gingerbread house vanished mysteriously. She told her husband, "Those naughty children are at it again. They don't understand all they have to do is knock on the door and I'll give them my gingerbread treats."</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/gingerbread/page1.jpg" alt="Grandma bakes gingerbread"/>
      <p>One day she made a special batch of gingerbread men because they were extra big. Unfortunately for the last gingerbread man she ran out of batter and he was half the size of the others.</p>
      <p>She decorated the gingerbread men with care, each having socks, shirt and pants of different colors. When it came to the little gingerbread man she felt sorry for him and gave him more color than the others. "It doesn't matter he's small," she thought, "He'll still be tasty."</p>
      <p>Putting the rack on the kitchen windowsill she left it there to cool and went to finish her laundry. The gingerbread men lay quietly, their frosted eyes gazing at the sky with its puffy clouds.</p>
      <p>At that moment a voice came from nowhere. "Get up. Get up. Come with me."</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/gingerbread/page2.jpg" alt="Butterfly"/>
      <p>Everyone looked to see who was speaking.</p>
      <p>It was a butterfly flying just outside the window. Butterflies are naturally beautiful, but her wings were an exceptionally pretty marbled blue.</p>
      <p>"Come with me," she urged again.</p>
      <p>The gingerbread men didn't react except to keep staring. All but the smallest gingerbread man who jumped up from the tray and leaped off the kitchen windowsill onto the grass below faster than you could say "hurry."</p>
      <p>"Where are we going?" he asked breathlessly.</p>
      <p>"Away." And before the butterfly had finished speaking children appeared in the yard. Spying the little gingerbread man they started shrieking with delight and began chasing him.</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/gingerbread/page3.jpg" alt="Kids playing"/>
      <p>"Stop, stop," they shouted. "We want to eat you."</p>
      <p>But with his little legs churning the gingerbread man only ran faster. He yelled,</p>
      <p>"I won't stop.</p>
      <p>Run, run as fast as you can.</p>
      <p>You can't catch me.</p>
      <p>I'm the gingerbread man."</p>
      <p>And truly those children could not catch him. Once out of their sight he continued running until he had reached a pasture where two horses were grazing. He sat down on a rock near the fence.</p>
      <p>"Don't stop," said the butterfly fluttering nearby.</p>
      <p>"I want to rest," he argued.</p>
      <p>That was a mistake as one of the horses trotted over to the fence and whinnied. "Oh you smell so good little gingerbread man. Come over here so I can smell you better."</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/gingerbread/page4.jpg" alt="Horse"/>
      <p>The little gingerbread man shook his head, but suddenly that horse jumped the fence and began galloping after him, so he had to run even faster. He called out,</p>
      <p>"I outran children and I'll outrun you.</p>
      <p>Run, run as fast as you can.</p>
      <p>You can't catch me.</p>  
      <p>I'm the gingerbread man."</p>
      <p>And truly, that horse could not catch him.</p>
      <p>The next time he rested the little gingerbread man took care to lie amongst the grass well off the road where no one would see him.</p>
      <p>"Everybody wants to eat me," he complained to the butterfly. "Do you want to eat me, too?"</p>
      <p>Laughing she answered. "I love the smell of gingerbread. It's better than my favorite flowers. But I sip nectar, not gingerbread. Besides, you're my friend and friends don't eat friends."</p>
      <p>Pleased to hear that he had a friend the little gingerbread man was about to reply when again they were interrupted. A farmer's dog with a keen nose had come to investigate. Licking his muzzle at the sight of the gingerbread man, the dog said.</p>
      <p>"Excuse me for interrupting, but little gingerbread man you look so good. I mean tired. Please stay awhile and rest if you like."</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/gingerbread/page5.jpg" alt="Dog"/>
      <p>As the dog talked, he stepped closer and closer. The closer he stepped, the more nervous became the little gingerbread man. When the butterfly flitted from her grass perch in alarm, the little gingerbread man took off running with the dog nipping at his tiny heels. He shouted,</p>
      <p>"I outran children. I outran a horse,</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I'll outrun you, too.</p>
      <p>Run, run as fast as you can.</p>
      <p>You can't catch me.</p>
      <p>I'm the gingerbread man."</p>
      <p>And truly that dog could not catch him.</p>
      <p>At last the little gingerbread man and the butterfly reached a stream.</p>
      <p>It wasn't a very big stream unless you are a tiny gingerbread man. To him it was a river. From out behind a bush sauntered a red fox stopping to stretch because he had just awakened from a nap. Looking at the gingerbread man he said nonchalantly, "May I help you?"</p>
      <p>The butterfly was quick to respond. "No thank you. We're going to fly across this stream. We don't need your help."</p>
      <p>Smiling, the wily fox glanced at the butterfly before turning to the little gingerbread man, "You're going to carry him? I've no doubt Ms. Butterfly that you have good intentions, but you're only a bug. You couldn't carry anything anywhere, let alone this gingerbread man across the stream. You'll drop him. I guarantee it!"</p>
      <p>The little gingerbread man was confused. He knew that his butterfly friend had good intentions but could she really carry him? He doubted it. Her wings were so thin and delicate. The thought of him falling into the cold water and crumbling to damp bits was frightening. He said to the fox, "I outran children. I outran a horse, and I outran a dog. Will you keep me safe and not eat me?"</p>
      <p>"Of course!" the wily fox quickly assured him before the butterfly could object. "I eat only meat and I had a full meal just before my nap. Here, ride on my bushy tail. Let's go before I change my mind."</p>
      <p>So the little gingerbread man climbed onto the fox's tail and they entered the water.</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/gingerbread/page6.jpg" alt="Fox swimming"/>
      <p>Unfortunately the fox's tail began dipping into the water. "You're too heavy for my tail, he said. Climb onto my back."</p>
      <p>The little gingerbread man did as he was asked.</p>
      <p>But the water began creeping up the fox's back forcing the little gingerbread man to climb higher to the fox's neck. "That's not good enough, I'm afraid," said the wily fox. "Climb to my head."</p>
      <p>Now the little gingerbread man was terrified, but what could he do? He climbed to the fox's ears.</p>
      <p>"Oh, little gingerbread man, you have to climb onto my nose," insisted the wily fox, "otherwise I can't help you. Don't you see the water is getting even deeper?"</p>
      <p>So the little gingerbread man reluctantly climbed onto the fox's nose. The moment he did, that wily fox tossed him into the air, opening his jaws wide with anticipation. The little gingerbread man's eyes rounded with fear because he knew he was going to be eaten. It didn't matter now how fast he could run.</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/gingerbread/page7.jpg" alt="Fox eats gingerbread"/>
      <p>But the little gingerbread man and the wily fox had forgotten about the butterfly. She swooped into that fox's jaws, grabbing her friend by one leg and rescuing him from an awful fate. She flew higher and higher until the stream and the fox were but spots on the landscape.</p>
      <p>"You <i>can</i> carry me," cried the little gingerbread man.</p>
      <p>"Yes," she answered. "I'm stronger than you could imagine. Now I'll take you somewhere safe."</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/gingerbread/page8.jpg" alt="Butterfly carries gingerbread man"/>
      <p>She flew with him over farm fields and forests and even mountains. It felt like they had been in the sky forever when they reached a lake, its waters calm like pale glass. There was an island in the middle of the lake lined with forest trees. And among the trees was where the butterfly took the little gingerbread man. She flew down, down, and down until they came to the foot of a pine tree.</p>
      <p>The little gingerbread man could not believe his eyes. Beneath that pine tree was the most beautiful gingerbread house.</p>
      <p>Through the front door of the gingerbread house came a gingerbread man and a gingerbread woman. Seeing the butterfly and her companion they smiled excitedly waving their gingerbread hands.</p>
      <p>"Oh, what have you brought us?" cried the gingerbread woman. Evidently she knew the butterfly very well.</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/gingerbread/page9.jpg" alt="Gingerbread family"/>
      <p>"I think that's obvious, dear" said the gingerbread man. "She's brought us a gingerbread boy. Do you realize that now we can be the family we always wanted?"</p>
      <p>It was true. The butterfly had intended all along to bring these three together. The little gingerbread man had not known that he was, in reality, a gingerbread boy. It was all so sudden, but wonderful. When both his gingerbread parents each gave him a loving hug he knew he was home.</p>
      <p>The gingerbread family went inside their gingerbread house to celebrate with the butterfly remaining outside on the roof. She was content just smelling the gingerbread and sitting there quietly, whether it was day or night.</p>

      <p>They all lived happily ever after.</p>`,

      <p>Ten steps from the porch and twenty steps from the rose bushes," growled Bluebeard in Jimmy's dream one night. "There be treasure there! Aawrgh</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/pirate/2_dig_small.jpg" alt="A boy is digging" />
      <p>So the next day Jimmy began to dig. He dug until the hole was deep and the dirt pile was high.</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/pirate/3_dig_med.jpg" alt="A boy is digging" />
      <p>He kept digging. The hole got deeper and the dirt pile got higher.</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/pirate/4_dig_large.jpg" alt="A boy is digging" />
      <p>He dug until the hole was deepest and the dirt pile was at its highest. He sighed. "I'm too tired. I can't dig anymore." Then he spied something...</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/pirate/5_bone.jpg" alt="A boy dug a hole" />
      <p>...but it was only one of Woofy's bones. Instead of treasure, all Jimmy had was a dog bone, a hole, and a big pile of dirt to fill it in with. He thought "That pirate lied to me!"</p>
      <img src="http://www.magickeys.com/books/pirate/6_mother.jpg" alt="A boy dug a hole" />
      <p>But when Jimmy's mother saw what he had done, she clasped her hands and smiled a smile from here to Sunday. "Oh, thank you, Jimmy. I always wanted a rhododendron bush planted just there. Here's $5.00 for digging that hole."</p>

    <p>The Halloween House is big and old. I'm told that on Halloween night things happen there.</p>
    <img src='http://www.magickeys.com/books/halloween/house.jpg' alt='Halloween house'/>
    <p>Now Suzie's moved in--she's only 4--along with her brother, her father and mother, and little Picador. He's their dog. Well, maybe half a dog. He's a Chihuahua, as small as they come.</p>
    <p>Suzie's room is in the attic. It's no fun. With a high ceiling, cold and gloomy, and shadows that run halfway up the walls. Suzie hides under the blanket. Picador too. Come on, he's no guard dog.</p>
    <p>Suzie's mom bought her a bear. A teddy bear named Teddy. He's big and fluffy and Suzie adores him. "I love you so much" she says. Then she wraps her arms around him, snuggling like a cat ready to purr while Picador buries himself in all that fur.</p>
    <p>The Halloween House's attic may be scary, but Teddy's not. Around his neck he wears a blue scarf with red polka dots. On his back paws are black tennis shoes tied with lace and plenty of knots.</p>
    <p>Something is silly about that teddy bear. He's got a goofy smile from ear to ear. It's kind of lopsided and sweet, although not quite complete. He was cheap when Suzie's mom bought him at the Dollar Store.</p>
    <p>But his smile is always there.</p>
    <p>When scratching and squeaking come from the walls,</p>
    <p>Teddy smiles.</p>
    <p>When clothes on the floor become strange figures in piles,</p>
    <p>Teddy smiles.</p>
    <p>When an invisible spider's miles of cobweb fades away in the morning,</p>
    <p>Teddy smiles.</p>
    <p>Tonight is Suzie's first Halloween at the Halloween House. She has finished her trick or treating, she did it earlier in the evening. She dressed up as a pumpkin with an orange glow--and now her two bags of candy overflow onto the floor.</p>
    <img src='http://www.magickeys.com/books/halloween/girl.jpg' alt='Suzie'/>
    <p>It's midnight and everyone's asleep. Not a peep, until suddenly there's a tapping at the door.</p>
    <p>"Tap, tap....tap." It starts out soft and low and then changes into a steady beat, beat, beat as though a giant's heart is nudging the door.</p>
    <p class="smiles">Teddy smiles.</p>
    <p>A thin mist streams from a crack in the corner, turns into a snake sliding across the floor.</p>
    <p class="smiles">Teddy smiles.</p>
    <p>Next, at the window appears a witch 200 years old with a black hat hiding half her face and the wrinkles it holds.  She slips right through the glass as though it isn't there at all. Once inside, she stands up, six feet tall.</p>
    <p>Teddy smiles.</p>
    <p>A long legged spider with big fangs drops from the ceiling and hangs only five feet over the bed where Suzie and Picador peacefully sleep.</p>
    <p>The snake, the witch and the spider slither, creep and dangle closer, growing bigger as they go. They're up to no good. This can't be happening.</p>
    <p>But Teddy is watching. He smiles no more. The upturned side of his lip droops down, while the other part of his lip lifts up. Teddy's smile turns into a snarl.</p>
    <p>When the three monsters almost reach the bed, Teddy gets up. But more than that, he begins to grow, although much faster and bigger than they. His tennis shoes pop off and his scarf floats away. Sweet, smiling Teddy turns into a Grizzly bear, the biggest, meanest Grizzly of your imagination.</p>
    <p>Standing on his back paws, stretched to the ceiling Teddy is terrifying. Fortunately, Suzie and Picador are still sleep.</p>
    <p>The snake, the witch, and the spider stop growing. They stare at him. There's wonder and shock in their eyes. This is an unexpected surprise.</p>
    <p>Then Teddy roars! It's so loud, it doesn't help to cover your ears. And the ghouls hear it. This Grizzly is beyond their worst fears. With a puff and a poof they disappear.</p>
    <p>Suzie is instantly awake, her eyes big and round. With a frightened yip Picador bolts from under the covers trembling with dread. But they see nothing, nothing at all, because the monsters have fled.</p>
    <p>And Teddy is suddenly Teddy again. How could that be? It happened so fast, there was nothing to see, except his shoes are across the room and his scarf is at the bottom of the bed.</p>
    <img src='http://www.magickeys.com/books/halloween/teddy.jpg' alt='Teddy'/>
    <p>Gone is the snake. Gone is the witch. Gone is the spider and the beating heart at the door. It's quite obvious they'll never return. Nevermore. At least not to this Halloween House so long as this bear stays around and he will stay. Because he is loved.</p>
    <p>Have no fear, Teddy's here.</p>
    <p>...and he smiles.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Once there was an elderly widow, Chen Ma, who lived with her only son inside a forest in the Shanxi Province. Her son was one of the tiger hunters licensed by the local magistrate, following the same profession of his father and grandfather before him. His share of the profits from the sale of tiger skins, meat and bones was sufficient to keep the small mud hut well provisioned for himself and his old mother.</p>

      <p>All was well until a particularly bitter winter. During a snowstorm, Chen Ma's son was separated from his fellow hunters and became food for a hungry tigress.</p>

      <p>After her initial shock and grief subsided, Chen Ma took stock of her own utterly desperate situation -- an old woman left all alone. She went and implored the magistrate to provide her with compensation for the loss of her son, who was her only source of support. The magistrate decreed that henceforth, she would have a small share of profits from the kill of each tiger by the hunters. Needless to say, his decision was not taken well by the hunters, who had plenty of mouths of their own to feed -- both old and young.</p>
      <img src='http://www.magickeys.com/books/tigerson/hunters3.jpg' alt='little tiger'/>
      <p>So, when the hunters succeeded in killing the tigress that ate Chen Ma's son, they decided not to give her a share of the profits. Instead, they brought her the tigress' newborn cub. He was a small quivery ball of golden fur with wobbly legs and toothless gums. The rope they tied around his neck was so tight that it was practically choking him. Instantly, Chen Ma's heart went out to this helpless creature, whose jade-green eyes were glistening with tears.</p>
      <p>After the hunters left, the tiger cub wobbled to where Chen Ma sat and lay at her feet. She bent down to rub his ears and he licked her shoes with his soft tongue.</p>

      <p>The elderly widow looked at the tiger baby and sighed. "They told me to butcher you, to salt and smoke your flesh for my meat supply. Your skin would make warm boots for my feet; your bones are good for making Tiger Bone Wine to ease the pain in my joints. But oh, how can I bear to kill you? You are so young and vital, while I am so old and frail."</p>
      <img src='http://www.magickeys.com/books/tigerson/cubatfeet3.jpg' alt='little tiger'/>
      <p>And so, Chen Ma untied the rope from the little tiger's neck and fed him a paste of cooked roots with her fingers. Her son had a good supply of grains and roots in the attached shed and she planned to stretch the food out to last the winter.</p>

      <p>When the store of the firewood was running low, Chen Ma was unable to keep her bedroll on top of the kang warm (a kang is a bed base built of bricks with space for a small fire). So she slept curling against the baby tiger, whose soft fur was cozy and warm.</p>

      <p>Once ever so often, women from nearby villages would bring sewing for Chen Ma to do. She was very handy with a needle. They paid her for her labor with dried venison and small sacks of grain. At first they did not find the little tiger's presence alarming; he was no bigger than a piglet. However, when spring came, he had grown into the size of a calf, showing a full set of teeth and claws. The women told their hunter husbands and the men came to kill the young tiger.</p>
      <p>Chen Ma armed herself with her son's hunting spear and threatened to gut anyone who dared to harm her beloved pet.</p>

      <p>"I've lost both husband and son. This tiger is the only companion I have now. I shall go to the magistrate and request to adopt him as my son."</p>

      <p>The hunters thought the old woman had become mad and jeered at her. But since she was so determined, they dared not kill her tiger without the magistrate's permission. So they followed Chen Ma and her tiger all the way to the official's judgment hall.</p>

      <p>"Venerable Mother," said the magistrate. "Your request is most unusual. Are you not afraid that some day the tiger might revert to his wild nature and devour you?"</p>
      <img src='http://www.magickeys.com/books/tigerson/magistrate3.jpg' alt='tiger'/>
      <p>"Honorable sir," replied the old widow with tears in her eyes. "What is there to fear? I have lived too long. The only worry I have now is being left utterly alone. Please let me adopt this young tiger, for he has become like a son in my affections."</p>

      <p>The kindly magistrate did not have the heart to refuse such an ancient woman's pleading. So he had his assistant draw up a document for the tiger's adoption.</p>

      <p>In order to protect the tiger from the hunters' arrows and spears, the magistrate ordered a large copper pendent made to hang around the beast's neck. The words "Fu Chee" were engraved on the pendent meaning Tiger Son. To show her deep gratitude, Chen Ma knelt down in front of the magistrate and knocked her forehead three times. Then she led Fu Chee back to their home in the forest.</p>
      <img src='http://www.magickeys.com/books/tigerson/cave3.jpg' alt='cave'/>
      <p>By next winter, Fu Chee had grown into his maximum size. Chen Ma's hut was in danger of collapsing whenever the tiger became playful. Reluctantly, she allowed Fu Chee to make his home inside a cave nearby.</p>
      <img src='http://www.magickeys.com/books/tigerson/gift3.jpg' alt='tiger'/>
      <p>However, the affectionate tiger came back to visit his adopted mother often, always bearing a gift in his mouth -- a dead deer or a large piece of tree branch. Also, he still liked to lick her shoes and to have his ears rubbed. Chen Ma's needs were being cared for just as if her natural son was still alive!</p>
      <p>After Chen Ma died at the ripe old age past one hundred, the hunters noticed Fu Chee guarded her tomb nightly. They left him unmolested as he had never attacked any humans or domestic animals. This went on for a number of years and then one day the tiger was seen no more.</p>
      <img src='http://www.magickeys.com/books/tigerson/tomb3.jpg' alt='tiger'/>
      <p>Out of deep respect and admiration for the filial tiger son, the hunters erected a small stone monument at Chen Ma's tomb with Fu Chee's story engraved on it. Henceforth, Fu Chee became a household legend in that part of Shanxi Province.</p>
